# Create GitHub Repository

## Steps to Create and Push to GitHub:

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new

2. **Create a new repository**:
   - Repository name: `RainDrop-Commander`
   - Description: `AI supervisor suite for auditing classification rules in RainDrop's DeepSearch feature`
   - Visibility: Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. **After creating the repository**, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/Users/srirammuralidharan/AI Projects/raindrop-Commander"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RainDrop-Commander.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Alternative: If you want me to help you push after you create the repo

Once you've created the repository on GitHub, let me know and I can help you add the remote and push the code.
